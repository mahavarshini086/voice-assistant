I just hacked my way to building a custom Voice Assistant, powered entirely by Google's Gemini API! Forget buying an off-the-shelf smart speaker—this is a secure, blazing-fast conversational AI built 100% from scratch.

The best part? Combining the power of an LLM with native web features.

Here's the Tech Breakdown:

🔒 Secure Brain: Node.js/Express acts as a server proxy, protecting the Gemini API Key while providing contextual memory via a chat session.

⚡ Zero-Latency Voice: Used the browser’s Web Speech API for instant Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)—it’s conversational, not command-based!

✨ Custom Command Center: Designed a sleek, futuristic UI with pure HTML/CSS to make the interaction feel like a console from a sci-fi movie.
